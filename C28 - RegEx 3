Instructions from your teacher:
Problem 1:

Write a JavaScript function to count the number of vowels in a given string using a regular expression. DO NOT USE loops or if statements
(Hint: use exec or match and look at the modifiers on the website below)

use the name:
function countVowels

Problem 2:

Write a JavaScript function to test if the words: dog, cat, or chicken is in a string.

(Hint: you will need to use \b for a word boundary)

Simply put: \b allows you to perform a "whole words only" search using a regular expression in the form of \bword\b.  A "word character" is a character that can be used to form words. All  characters that are not "word characters" are "non-word characters" 

use the name:
function animalCount

function countVowels(str){
  var regex = /[a,e,i,o,u]/gi;
  var test = str.match(regex);
  return test.length;
  
  
}

//console.log(countVowels("apple"))

function animalCount(str){
  
  //var reg_ex = /^[\\bdog\\b]$^[\\bcat\\b]$^[ \\bchicken\\]$/gi;
  var reg_ex = /\b(dog|cat|chicken)\b/
  var test_ = reg_ex.test(str);
  return test_;
}
console.log(animalCount("dog"));
