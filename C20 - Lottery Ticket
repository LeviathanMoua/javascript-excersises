Problem

You have a green lottery ticket, with  ints a, b, and c on it. If the numbers are all different from each  other, the result is 0. If all of the numbers are the same, the result  is 20. If two of the numbers are the same, the result is 10.

Examples:
greenTicket(1, 2, 3) → 0
greenTicket(2, 2, 2) → 20
greenTicket(1, 1, 2) → 10 


To test the code: (copy and paste this below the function)
var output = greenTicket(2,1,1);
console.log(output);


*/

function greenTicket(a, b, c) {
   if(a == b && a == c && b == a && b == c && c == a && c == b)
        return 20;
          
    if(a == b || b == c || c == a) //|| = or
        return 10;
                    
    if(a != b && a != c && c != a) //!= equals not equal to
        return 0;
                            
    return 0;
}
var output = greenTicket(2,2,1);
console.log(output);
