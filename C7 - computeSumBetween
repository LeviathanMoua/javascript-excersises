/*
Instructions from your teacher:
Write a function called "computeSumBetween".

Given 2 integers, "computeSumBetween" returns the sum between the two given integers, beginning at num1, and excluding num2.

Notes:
* The sum between 1 and 4 is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
* If num2 is not greater than num1, it should return 0.

Copy and paste this below the function to test it.

var output = computeSumBetween(2, 5);
console.log(output); // --> 9
*/


function computeSumBetween(num1, num2) {
  // your code here
  //I want to add the numbers together from num1 to the number before num2. 
  //I want to start off from num1 and add up numbers into an array until they equal num2. 
  
  
  //set sum to 0;
  var sum = 0;
  //start at num1. Update sum and keep adding until before num2:
  
  for(var start = num1; start < num2; start++){
    sum = sum + start;
  }

  return sum;
}
var output = computeSumBetween(2, 5);
console.log(output); // --> 9
