/*
Instructions from your teacher:
Write a function called "calculateBillTotal".

Given the pre tax and pre tip amount of a meal, "calculateBillTotal" returns the total amount due after tax and tip.

Notes:
* Assume that sales tax is 9.5% and tip is 15%.
* Do NOT tip on the sales tax, only on the pre tip amount.

var output = calculateBillTotal(20);
console.log(output); // --> 24.9
*/


function calculateBillTotal(preTaxAndTipAmount) {
  // your code here
  tax_amount = preTaxAndTipAmount * 0.095;
  tip_amount = preTaxAndTipAmount * 0.15;
  return preTaxAndTipAmount + tax_amount + tip_amount;
  
}
